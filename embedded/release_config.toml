# Known stable version letters (A through J)
# CDDA uses alphabetical naming: 0.A, 0.B, 0.C, ... 0.G (current), 0.H (future)
# Listed newest-first for priority when searching
# Includes future letters (H, I, J) that will return 404 until released
# CDDA releases ~1 major version per year, so this covers several years

# Maximum point release number to check (e.g., 0.F-3)
# Set high enough to handle any reasonable point release count
